// GOTO RECURSION

If no goto is executed during a step the current_step and current_flow will be the same.
Recursion is done by default

Maybe just get a index of how much recursion has been done on this step ?

// WARNINGS

Need to add Warnings vector inside MessageData

// MESSAGE_DATA

Remove next_flow and next_step since this is done internally inside interpreter now.
Just need to notify the manager at every action I'm doing so it will keep trace of what I am doing.

// EXECUTE_STEP

Remove duplicating arguments !

// HOLD

If sender is none (which means the interpreter is used locally) maybe read on stdin ?
